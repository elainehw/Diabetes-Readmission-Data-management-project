# Diabetes-Readmission-Data-management-project
By Qinpei Zou, Amber Camilleri, Junhong Xu, Rui Ying, He Wang.

This is a group project about diabetes readmission in data management class. We aim to improve the quality of care of diabetes patients by helping hospitals better understand how they can provide additional assistance to patients with increased risk of readmission. Our goal for this project is to reduce the readmission rate for patients with diabetes.

The dataset represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes.  

Based on the dataset, we firstly conclude three hypotheses:

(1)We can segment different groups using demographic information. Some demographic segments have higher risk of readmission and some have lower risk of readmission.

(2)There is relationship between additional diagnosis (other than diabetes) and readmission rate.

(3)Doing A1C test has a positive effect on reducing readmission rate.

We analyzed historical data for patients with diabetes in order to understand the attributes and conditions that lead to patient readmission and provide our recommendations for hospital and insurance company with how to reduce the 30-day readmission rate.
